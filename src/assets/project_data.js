    des: "I developed a comprehensive e-commerce platform using the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) stack, bolstered by Bootstrap for responsive web design. The site features seamless integration of the Braintree payment gateway to facilitate secure transactions with various credit cards. User authentication and session management are handled using JWT tokens, ensuring robust security measures for signup, login, and role-based access control for both users and administrators. Passwords are encrypted using bcrypt to further enhance data security. Key functionalities include product search, cart management, and user dashboards for profile editing and order tracking. An intuitive admin dashboard enables efficient category and product management, order tracking, and user administration. The platform enhances user experience with notification pop-ups for critical actions such as login, logout, and checkout, alongside product suggestions on detailed product pages. This project exemplifies my proficiency in full-stack development and my ability to create robust, user-friendly e-commerce solutions.",
